First User to create:
    1. start a mongod process
    2. Connect it with mongo client
    3. use admin database to create this user
    4. Then create this user before creating further users

    db.createUser(
        {   
            user: "Arvind",
            pwd: "testtest",
            roles: [ { db: "admin", role: "userAdmin" } ]
        }
    )

    Important:
        1. All users must be created on admin database
        2. It is not recomended to use root user
        3. We must create a admin user first inside mongo shell
        4. userAdmin has all previlages than other users

    Commands:
        db.getUsers() // Get the available users
        db.grantRolesToUser( "dba",  [ { db: "playground", role: "dbOwner"  } ] ) // granting roles for other users
