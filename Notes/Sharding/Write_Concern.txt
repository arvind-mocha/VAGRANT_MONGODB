Write Comcerns:
    1. We have the power to check wheater the inserted or updated or deleted document is reflected to all nodes

    2. Syntax => db.collection.insert({values},{writeConcern: {w:3,wtimeout: 60}})

    3. if w = 0 no acknowladegement needed, if w = 1 which is default checks weather write is successfull only on primary node

    4. if w >= 2 waits for acknowledgement of primary and more the one secondary node,if w = "majority" waits for majoriy of node to acknowledege

    5. Increasing the w may also increase the time of response since need to check many nodes 
    
    6. wtimeout can be used to end process if take more time to acknowledge
