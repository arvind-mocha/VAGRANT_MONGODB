Mongos Configuration:
    // For indicating the primary shard or configuration server 
    sharding:       
        configDB: <replicaset name>/127.0.0.1:27020, 127.0.0.1:27021, 127.0.0.1:27022
    net:
        bindIp: localhost
        port: 27000
    security:
        keyFile: /var/mongodb/pki/m103-keyfile
    systemLog:
        destination: file
        path: /var/mongodb/db/node1/mongos.log

    For setting secondary shards visit replication file

    Note:
        1. config server is the primary server where data comes in and splitted to other shardes

        2. if conf file edited for any mongod process whiel they are running, don't kill the process.

        3. connect to the secondary and shut it down and run again so the updated conf file is used

        4. Do this for all secondary nodes

        5. atlast connect to primary and step it down and electe a secondary as primary node

        6. Now shut sown that last node and rerun it 

    Commands:
        sh.status()	// check status
	
	    sh.addShard("<replicaset name>/localhost:27012")	// add shared (replicaset) 

    Important:
        1. use config database while using sharded clusters.it has details about sharded key, shards available, chunks and more
