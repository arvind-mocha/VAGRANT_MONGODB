Sharding:
    1. Collection of replica sets is called shardes

    2. we can split our data and store it on different replica sets based on criteria

    3. each replica set can have any number of nodes

    4. We have a prmary replica set and other replica sets are like secondary

    5. we must metion sharding clusterRole for secondary replica sets in the configration file

Configuration:
    Primary replica set:
        check Replication file step 1

    Secondary replica sets:

        csrs1.conf:
    
            sharding:                           //Must metion this for secondary replica sets
                clusterRole: configsvr 
            storage:
                dbPath: /var/mongodb/db/csrs1
            net:
                bindIp: localhost
                port: 27020
            security:
                authorization: enabled
                keyFile: /var/mongodb/pki/m103-keyfile
            systemLog:
                destination: file
                path: /var/mongodb/db/csvr1/mongod.log
                logAppend: true
            processManagement:
                fork: true
            replication:
                replSetName: set2

        csrs2.conf, csrs3.conf:
            Just need to change storage path, port,log path
