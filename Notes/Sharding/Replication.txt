Replication:
    1. Multiple Mongod Process combines to for a replica set
    2. A replica set can contain upto 50 nodes
    3. If the primary node fails then a secondary node would be elected as the primary node
    4. It is always recommended to have odd number of nodes for voting purpose
    5. Arbitary node do not have voting previleges

Performing replication:
    Step 1:
        node1.conf:

            storage:
                dbPath: /var/mongodb/db/node1       // Must creat this directory
            net:
                bindIp: localhost
                port: 27011
            security:
                authorization: enabled
                keyFile: /var/mongodb/pki/m103-keyfile      // check keyfile.txt
            systemLog:
                destination: file
                path: /var/mongodb/db/node1/mongod.log
                logAppend: true
            processManagement:
                fork: true
            replication:
                replSetName: set1
        
        node1.conf:

            storage:
                dbPath: /var/mongodb/db/node2
            net:
                bindIp: localhost
                port: 27012
            security:
                authorization: enabled
                keyFile: /var/mongodb/pki/m103-keyfile
            systemLog:
                destination: file
                path: /var/mongodb/db/node1/mongod.log
                logAppend: true
            processManagement:
                fork: true
            replication:
                replSetName: set1

        node3.conf:

            storage:
                dbPath: /var/mongodb/db/node3
            net:
                bindIp: localhost
                port: 27013
            security:
                authorization: enabled
                keyFile: /var/mongodb/pki/m103-keyfile
            systemLog:
                destination: file
                path: /var/mongodb/db/node1/mongod.log
                logAppend: true
            processManagement:
                fork: true
            replication:
                replSetName: set1

        
        Then Run each mongod process:
            sudo mongod -f node1.conf
            sudo mongod -f node2.conf
            sudo mongod -f node3.conf

            Command to check for running mongod process => sudo ps -ef | grep mongod

        Note:
            1. Just port name and storage folder name as changed
            2. Now all instances are running but they are not connected to each other


    Step 2:
        1. Connect to a mongod instance at any among the port using mongo 
        
        2. run this Command inside mongoshell => rs.initiate() to initiate our current node as primary node
        
        3. create a root user at admin database and exit 
        
        4. connect to the mongod again using command => 
           mongo --host "<replicaset name>/localhost:27011" -u "<username>" -p "<password>" --authenticationDatabase "<database>"
        
        5. rs.status() is the command used to find the status like available members in a replica set, which node is primary node and more

        6. Command to add other running mongod into our replica set => rs.add("localhost:27012") and use rs.status() to check status

        7. rs.isMaster() command is used to get basic infomations about the entire replica set

    Step 3:
        1. rs.stepDown() is the command use to electe a secondary node to primary safly and we are automatically connected to the new primary 

        2. use rs.isMaster() to check the current primary node
