Configuration:
    1. Instead of using many falgs we could use configuration file to run our mongod process Which is much recomended
    2. .conf files are basically .yml files

    eg:
        storage:
            dbPath: "/data/db"
        systemLog:
            path: "/data/log/mongod.log"
            destination: "file"
            logAppend: true
        replication:
            replSetName: M103
        net:
            bindIp : "127.0.0.1,192.168.103.100"
        tls:
            mode: "requireTLS"
            certificateKeyFile: "/etc/tls/tls.pem"
            CAFile: "/etc/tls/TLSCA.pem"
        security:
            authorization: enabled
            keyFile: "/data/keyfile" // used for checking all nodes have same keyfile
        processManagement:
            fork: true
